# Part-Affinity-Field-Mobilenetv2
A lightweight Part Affinity Field-Mobilenetv2 model (Training and inference program) 

This program is created and modified with reference to https://github.com/NiteshBharadwaj/part-affinity.

The main novelty of this progrom is compression of Part Affinity Field(PAF) model with the fundamental structure Mobilenetv2, which reduces the original parammeter size from 200+MB to only 6.23MB without significant detection performance downgrade. Some testing resutls are shown below.
